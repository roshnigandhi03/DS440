# Recipe Generator using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain and Gemma-3-1b-it
This project implements an AI-powered Recipe Generator that produces customized recipes based on user-input ingredients. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced contextual relevance, using:

* LangChain for orchestration

* FAISS for efficient vector storage and retrieval

* Gemma-3-1b-it (a lightweight instruction-tuned model) for text generation.

Users input a list of available ingredients, and the system generates tailored recipes using both a semantic database of recipes and the generation capabilities of the language model.
